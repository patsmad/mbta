# Broad DSP Engineering Interview Take-Home
## Patrick Smadbeck

The project consisted of three parts:
(1) a main file which consumes input from the user from the command line or python shell
(2) src which contains the classes which fetch process and return the data
(3) tests which test the api converting code and mbta map functions

Before starting you might want to consider adding your API key to a config file in the same directory as main.py.
Call this file config.json (which can be copied from config.copy.json).
The API key can also be passed in from the command line.
